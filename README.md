This is a social media clone which is similar to facebook where you can follow and unfollow friends,post images and can also chat with friends in real time.
I used REACT JS for frontend and NODE JS for backend. Data is stored at a remote MONDODB server. 

Link for the social media app is https://socialmedia.azurewebsites.net/

Thankful to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HggSXt1Hzfk, with helped me a lot in designing backend as well as frontend of the website.
